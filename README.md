Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05257

## Installation
We use `python 3.9.7` and all necessary libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Dataset
The ACLED dataset is not accessible without an account.

To keep reproducibility possible. We provide two JSON files containing the `Event IDs` of the training and test set for the ACLED and GTD dataset.
- `data/gtd_samples_ids.json` and `data/acled_samples_ids.json`.
